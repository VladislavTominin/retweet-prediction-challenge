For this challenge, your mission is to accurately predict the number of retweets a tweet will get. We ask you to work on a novel Twitter dataset with the 2022 French presidential election as the central topic, that was created by members of the DaSciM group. The tweets used for building this dataset date from February 14, 2022 to April 5, 2022. This dataset corresponds to a large and coherent corpus consisting of small pieces of text related to the election candidates and major events during their campaigns. It contains tweet related information, such as the text and the number of hashtags, mentions and URLs contained in the tweet, and user related information as the number of followers and tweets that he has published.

Your solution can be based on supervised or unsupervised techniques or on a combination of both. You should aim for the minimum Mean Absolute Error (MAE) .
